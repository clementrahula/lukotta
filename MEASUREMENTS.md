## BitLocker/NTFS on the Patriot stick — 2026-09-02

Opened by Lukotta with a key taken from the Keychain. Nothing was typed: the
app found the key filed under `media:Patriot-Memory:247630659584:1048576` and
used it. Served at /Volumes/BACKUP2_TS, read-write.

                      200 small random files, one 64M file, one 3M file named
                      in Japanese/Greek/umlauts, one 180-character name, an

Item 4's unlock half had never been proven on any build before this. The
Keychain lookup that makes it work is the one shipped in 1.22.0-beta.9: the
key is searched for under the volume's fingerprint, the fingerprint remembered
from last time, the volume UUID, the device node, and finally under every key
the app holds, with a refused key falling silently through to the next.
